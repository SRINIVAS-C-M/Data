# Pycaret
With this basic project I am starting my journey to learn a new Library Pycaret that I found interesting.
This is an ML Library that automates lot of processes.
Here I took a dataset of house prices and in my dataset everything was numerical datatype.
I imported pycaret and loaded the file and did basic things
setup, compare_models, evaluate_model, predict_model and save_model.
Then we could use the model any time by using load_model which will load an sklean pipeline 
that we can deploy later if we want.
