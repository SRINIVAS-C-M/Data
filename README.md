# Pycaret
With this basic project I am starting my journey to learn a new Library Pycaret which I found interesting
Here I took a dataset of house prices and in my dataset everything was numerical datatype
I imported pycaret and loaded the file and used 5 basic things
setup, compare_models, evaluate_model, predict_model, save_model
and then you could use the model any time by using load_model which will load an sklean pipeline 
that we can deploy later if we want
